          <h2>10 years experience</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Kate and I've been making people fall in love with English for 10 years. Throughout my career I've been teaching
            students of different ages and from different countries, both face to face and online. I have taught English in Russia, in China and in the UK.
            I don't promise miracles, it is a lot to do with your motivation and dedication, but I will help you find one.
             and discover what you're capable of.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Qualified TESOL teacher</h2>            
          <p>I hold an internationally recognized Trinity TESOL certificate which I studied for in Southampton, the UK. </p>  

          <h2>Based in the UK</h2>
          <p>I live in England, so I can guarantee that the English you learn is 100% real and modern. I only teach words and expressions
            that are used in real English by native speakers. However, I do not focus on British English only. I always give different accents 
            and options, so that the students can choose what they prefer.
          </p>

          <h2>Tailor made lessons</h2>
             <p>In your first lessons I will ask you about the reasons why you would like to learn English,
              and we will outline your goals together. The lessons will be structured based on your goals and taking into account your
              learning style. We will focus on the types of exercises that are interesting and effective for you.
             </p>
          <h2>Interactive platform</h2>
          <p>All lessons are taught via an interactive platform, so there is no need to purchase any additional materials or write 
            down anything in your notebook (you can if you want to). You can go back to the materials any time you want, they are always with
          you as long as you have Internet access. </p>

          <h2>Flexible timetable</h2>
          <p>If you choose one-to-one lesson you won't have to have a strict timetable, we can always arrange lessons on different days and at 
            different times if that suits you better.
          </p>

          <h2>Any level welcome!</h2>
          <p>It doesn't matter whether you are an absolute beginner, quite an advanced English learner or are stuck somewhere in the middle
            I'll help you get started and achieve the level you desire.
          </p>
    
          English is a skill of the 21st century which gets you closer to your dreams whether it is to travel the world, find a good job in 
          an international company, immigrate into the country you like or make friends all over the world. 
           All you need to do to make your dream come true is to:
           book your first free lesson
           we will estimate your English level and outline the goals
           start learning
